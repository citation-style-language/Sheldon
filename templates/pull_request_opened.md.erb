Thank you for your submission to the Citation Styles Language styles repository.

Our automated test system will now run checks on your pull request to detect some common problems. E.g. it makes sure your styles are correctly named and validate against the CSL schema. You will be notified when the test report is ready, which usually takes just a few minutes.

The volunteers who maintain this repository and are in charge of accepting styles into the repository will also take a look, which can take a day or two. We might ask you to make some additional changes to make sure your styles follow all our [Style Requirements](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Style-Requirements).

If you need assistance at any point, please leave a comment and we'll get back to you. Feel free to write in Spanish, German, or Dutch if that's easier for you.
