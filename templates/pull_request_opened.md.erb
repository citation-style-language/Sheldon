Great! You just created a pull request to the Citation Styles Language styles repository.

Travis CI, our automated test system, will now run a few checks on your pull request to detect some common problems. For example, Travis will make sure that your styles are correctly named and validate against the CSL schema. We will inform you when the test report is ready, which usually takes just a few minutes.

We will also take a look, but this sometimes takes us a day or two. Like Travis, we try very hard to keep the styles repository neat and organized, so we will often ask you to make some minor changes to your styles before we accept them into our repository.

If you need assistance at any point, please leave a comment and we'll get back to you. We speak English, German, Spanish, and Dutch.
