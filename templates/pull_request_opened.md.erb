Thank you @<%= user['login'] %> for submitting to the Citation Styles Language
repository. Shortly, our automated test suite will check your submission to
ensure that there are no formal errors.

Please make sure that your filename, id, and link follows the conventions
outlined in 1,2,4,5,6 [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Style-Requirements).

While not technically required, we also ask that you include a link to online
documentation for the style with `rel="documentation"` as per 10.
[here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/wiki/Style-Requirements).

You can update your pull request by editing your style
[here](<%= head['repo']['html_url'] %>).
Click the pencil icon at the top right of that page.

Feel free to post here if you need any help.
